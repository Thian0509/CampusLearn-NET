    <summary><b>CampusLearn Project Architecture</b></summary>
    <p>This project is structured using a Clean Architecture approach, with each component serving a distinct purpose. The separation of concerns makes the codebase more organized, maintainable, and testable.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>CampusLearn.Api</strong>: <br> This is the presentation layer and the entry point of the application. It's responsible for handling incoming web requests (like HTTP requests from a browser or another service) and exposing the application's functionality. This project contains the controllers that define the web API endpoints and references the Application project to access the business logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CampusLearn.Application</strong>: <br> This is the application layer. It contains the core business logic, use cases, and application-specific rules. It defines the operations the application can perform, such as "create a course" or "enroll a student," and orchestrates the flow of data between the other layers. This layer depends on the Domain and Infrastructure projects to perform its tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CampusLearn.Domain</strong>: <br> This is the domain layer or the core of the application. It contains the essential business entities (like Student or Course), value objects, and business rules that are independent of any specific technology. This project is at the center of the architecture and has no dependencies on the other projects, ensuring it remains focused on the business problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CampusLearn.Infrastructure</strong>: <br> This is the infrastructure layer. It handles all the technical details and external dependencies. This includes code for interacting with a database, external services, file systems, or other third-party libraries. This layer is referenced by the Application project to perform tasks like data persistence and by the API project for specific infrastructure-related concerns.
        </li>
    </ul>

  <summary><b>Assignment 2: Database Design & Implementation</b></summary>
  <br>
  <p>This assignment focused on designing and implementing a database schema for CampusLearn™, a peer-to-peer learning platform. The process involved defining key business rules, applying normalization principles, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and transforming the conceptual design into a practical database schema using MongoDB.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2>Business Rules & Normalization</h2>
  
  <h3>Normalization Principles Applied</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>First Normal Form (1NF):</b> Each table has a primary key and all columns contain a single, atomic value. Repeating groups were eliminated by creating separate tables (e.g., <code>StudentSubscriptions</code> and <code>TutorAssignments</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Second Normal Form (2NF):</b> All non-key attributes are fully dependent on their respective primary key. This prevents partial dependencies in tables with composite keys.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Third Normal Form (3NF):</b> Transitive dependencies have been removed. For example, a separate <code>Modules</code> table was created to ensure that non-key attributes (like <code>ModuleDepartment</code>) are directly dependent on the primary key, and only the primary key.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Document Model</h3>
  <p>Since MongoDB is a document-based database, the design also uses denormalization to optimize for common query patterns. The schema is a set of interrelated collections, with business rules mapped to either reference-based relationships or embedded document structures. Key collections include <code>users</code> (for students and tutors), <code>tutorApprovals</code>, <code>topics</code>, <code>posts</code>, <code>privateThreads</code>, and <code>notifications</code>. JSON Schema validators enforce domain integrity, while unique and compound indexes enforce entity and referential integrity.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2>Schema Implementation</h2>
  <p>The CampusLearn™ schema was implemented in MongoDB Atlas, with JSON Schema validators, unique indexes, and sample data to demonstrate its functionality and integrity.</p>
  
  <h3>Validators and Domain Integrity</h3>
  <p>Validators were used to enforce data types, field requirements, and format rules. For example, the <code>users</code> collection requires <code>fullName</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>role</code>, and <code>createdAt</code>, with a regular expression validator to ensure emails are from the correct Belgium Campus domain.</p>
  
  <h3>Indexes and Entity Integrity</h3>
  <p>Unique indexes were used to enforce entity integrity. For instance, a unique index on <code>users.email</code> prevents duplicate user registrations. Composite indexes, such as on <code>{tutorId, moduleId}</code> in the <code>tutorApprovals</code> collection, ensure that each tutor-module pairing is unique.</p>
  
  <h3>CRUD Demonstration</h3>
  <h4>Create</h4>
<pre><code>db.users.insertOne({
  fullName: "Demo Student",
  email: "demo@student.belgiumcampus.ac.za",
  role: "STUDENT",
  yearOfStudy: 1,
  createdAt: new Date()
});</code></pre>
  
  <h4>Read</h4>
<pre><code>db.users.find({ role: "STUDENT" }, { fullName: 1, email: 1 });</code></pre>
  
  <h4>Update</h4>
<pre><code>db.topics.updateOne(
  { title: "Help with ERD for CampusLearn" },
  { $set: { status: "ASSIGNED" } }
);</code></pre>
  
  <h4>Delete</h4>
<pre><code>db.materials.deleteOne({ title: "ERD Cheat-Sheet" });</code></pre>
  
  <h3>Aggregation Queries</h3>
  <p>Two aggregation pipelines were demonstrated to validate complex relationships and support advanced queries.</p>
  
  <h4>Topics with creator + module:</h4>
<pre><code>db.topics.aggregate([
  { $sort: { createdAt: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 },
  { $lookup: { from: "users", localField: "creatorId", foreignField: "_id", as: "creator" } },
  { $set: { creator: { $first: "$creator.fullName" } } },
  { $lookup: { from: "modules", localField: "moduleId", foreignField: "_id", as: "module" } },
  { $set: { module: { $first: "$module.code" } } },
  { $project: { title: 1, status: 1, creator: 1, module: 1 } }
]);</code></pre>
  
  <h4>Trending forum posts:</h4>
<pre><code>db.forumPosts.aggregate([
  { $lookup: { from: "forumVotes", localField: "_id", foreignField: "postId", as: "votes" } },
  { $set: { score: { $sum: "$votes.vote" } } },
  { $sort: { score: -1, createdAt: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 },
  { $project: { threadId: 1, snippet: { $substrBytes: ["$body", 0, 120] }, score: 1 } }
]);</code></pre>
  
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The CampusLearn™ database schema, designed with a balance of normalization and denormalization, provides a stable and scalable foundation for the platform. Through the implementation of JSON Schema validators and unique indexes, and the demonstration of CRUD operations and aggregation queries, the design proves its capability to handle real-world operations while maintaining data integrity and efficiency.</p>

<summary><b> Assignment 3 – System Architecture Design Specification </b></summary>
  
<h2>Architectural Style: Layered Architecture 🏛️</h2>
<p>The group chose a **Layered Architecture**, a **non-monolithic** style that organizes the system into distinct, horizontal layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility and depends only on the layer directly beneath it. This ensures that the system is a single, deployable unit while still being modular and allowing for independent development and scaling of each layer. The system will be a **web-based application**, accessible via standard browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

<h3>System Layers</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>**Presentation Layer**: Responsible for **user interaction**. It provides the web-based UI for users to access the system.</li>
  <li>**Application/Business Layer**: Manages the core logic of the application, including user registration, topic management, tutoring, and the AI chatbot. It handles requests from the UI and coordinates data operations.</li>
  <li>**Data Access Layer**: Handles all **database queries, API integrations**, and storage logic. It abstracts the database from the higher layers, managing communication between the business logic and the database.</li>
  <li>**Database/Storage Layer**: Stores and retrieves all data for users, topics, messages, and resources. **MongoDB** was chosen for its scalability and flexibility with semi-structured data.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Communication Methods</h3>
<p>Communication between the layers is primarily done via **RESTful APIs** between the frontend (Presentation Layer) and the backend (Application/Business Layer).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Design Patterns</h2>

<h3>Creational</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Singleton</strong> – Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.</li>
  <li><strong>Factory</strong> - Defines an interface for creating a single object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Structural</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adapter</strong> - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Behavioural</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strategy</strong> - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.</li>
  <li><strong>Observer</strong> - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Justification of Chosen Architecture</h2>

<h3>Why Layered Architecture Was Chosen 🚀</h3>
<ul>
  <li>**Clarity & Speed for a Small Team**: The strict separation of layers reduces ambiguity, making it clear where specific code should live.</li>
  <li>**Maintainability & Testability**: Business logic is separated from database concerns, enabling fast unit tests and safe migrations.</li>
  <li>**Scalability**: Layers can be scaled independently. For example, if user numbers increase, only the database or business layer might need to be scaled up.</li>
  <li>**Modularity**: Features like the AI chatbot or forum are independent services within the Business Layer.</li>
  <li>**Extensibility**: New APIs can be integrated into the Data Access Layer without a full system overhaul.</li>
  <li>**Future-Proof Enough**: While starting simple, this architecture allows for future extraction of specific services (e.g., a dedicated forum service) if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Other Architectures Were Not Chosen 🚫</h3>
<ul>
  <li>**Microservices**: Too operationally heavy for this scale, requiring complex service discovery and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
  <li>**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Unnecessary governance and middleware overhead for a single product.</li>
  <li>**Serverless**: Complicates stateful flows and introduces cold-start latency issues, which are not ideal for immediate user experience needs.</li>
  <li>**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Best for side effects, not for the core user experience that requires immediate confirmation.</li>
  <li>**Monolithic**: Blurs responsibilities, making testing and maintenance difficult.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion ✅</h2>
<p>Layered Architecture provides a stable and scalable foundation for CampusLearn. It's the most practical choice for a small team, enabling the fastest and safest path to project completion while aligning perfectly with the chosen MongoDB data model and leaving the door open for future growth.</p>
